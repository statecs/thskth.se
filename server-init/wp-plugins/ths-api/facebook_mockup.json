The amount of sprouts you bring, you can take back home with you. \n\nThe exchange will take place at Hyllan (by the microwaves) in Nymble. Between 17:00 and 17:30 you hand in your sprouts so that we will have a lot of beautiful sprouts to chose from when the exchange starts. While you wait, you can study the range of plants, mingle or have a fika at the caf\u00e9. For every sprout you hand in, you will get a ticket that will be swoped for the sprouts you would like to have. The exchange starts at 17:30 and will go on to 18:30. \n\nTo make it easy to know what plant the sprout will grow into be, please mark your sprouts with the name of the plant. \n\nYou can hand in any type of sprout, in a plastic bag with only wet paper or in a small pot, completely new from the plant or older with their own root systems, as long it will stay alive during the day, any solution is good.

We would like to present some of the over 300 people who Shaped the Armada last year. First out: Beata T\u00f6rneman, Team Leader: Lounges.\n\n# What position did you have in THS Armada 2015?\n- I was one of the Lounges Team Leader. Together with my co-Team Leader I was in charge of the two business lounges during the days of the career fair.\n\n# What was the best part of your position?\n- I loved my position, it suited me perfectly! I really enjoyed planning and setting up the lounges as we pictured them. In the beginning, I found it a bit challenging to make calls to find sponsors, but I got comfortable with it along the way. At the end it was really cool to see how great it all turned out! As Team Leaders, we were in charge of 12 hosts, which was the most fun part! We turned into a very close-knit group and had a very enjoyable time together!\n\n# Why should you engage yourself in THS Armada?\n- Because it\u2019s the most enjoyable project you can be part of during your studies! You will get to know so many great and wonderful people who you get to keep for the rest of your life, and in addition to that you will learn how to take responsibility and grow as an individual!\n\nShape the Armada, send us your application before this Friday! All information about the open positions at http:\/\/armada.nu\/#\/recruitment.",
